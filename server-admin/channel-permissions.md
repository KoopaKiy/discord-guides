# Channel Permissions


You have a server... now what? Permissions!

### What are Permissions?

Permissions are abilities to do specific things on each channel, or on the whole server. Permissions can be set in the 'server settings' or 'channel settings'

### How to work the Permissions.
### Usage

Following the below to find them, and learning what each does is the first step to using the permissions system.
The second part comes when you try to enter them in.
> Entering in permissions, one click gives you a ![firstclickpermissions](http://i.imgur.com/vIhIsi4.png) which means they do NOT have that permission. Second click gives you a ![secondclickpermissions](http://i.imgur.com/jbNHqV7.png) which means they DO have that permission. The ![noclickpermissions](http://i.imgur.com/jZ29OZn.png) means that the permissions they have on that server is based on the role permissions they have. 

> Example: Mod has 'Delete Messages' permission, but no permission on the channel. Mod can delete messages. If it was DISABLED on the channel, but ENABLED on the role Mod wouldn't be able to on that channel, but could on the others.

### Text Channel permissions

If you're making a new channel, you will have roles you can click to add to the permissions list at the creation of the channel itself.

If you are working with an already existing channel such as #general then you'll need to click the ![channelcog](http://i.imgur.com/U2YgO5r.png) on the channel tab, after that you click the setting permissions.

Once on this menu you have a list of options as shown above, from "Creation Instant Invite" to "Use External Emojis" 

### Voice Channel Permissions
Voice Channels are very similar to Text Channels in setup, but very different permissions. 

Creating a new Voice Channel this menu should popup allowing you to select roles for the permission list just like on a Channel.

If your working with an existing Voice chat, like General which comes with the server creation you need to click the ![channelcog](http://i.imgur.com/U2YgO5r.png) on the channel tab, same as a Text Channel.

From there click the setting perrmissions and you should see this.

Once on this menu you have multiple abilities on Voice Chat you can click, from the "Create Instant Invite" to "Use Voice Activity"


### Permission Key
### Here is how to use the permissions you've been shown how to find
Some permissions have ![questionmarkicon](http://i.imgur.com/0B0IoOI.png) which explain them. From there just use the below "Permissions Key" if you need more information.

### Moderation permissions
- Create Insant Invite
> This allows a user to create links that lead to that channel in the server.
- Manage Channel
>Manager Channel allows the user to delete or modify the channel. Example: Changing Channel name. (On Voice Chat changing Maximum Members)
- Manage Permissions
>Manage Permissions allows that role/user given the permission to edit who can/can't have any of the permissions.

### Text Channel Permissions
- Read/Send/Manage
> Ability to See the channel, talk on the channel, or delete messages on the channel.
- TTS messaging
> Being able to use Talk-To-Speech (TTS is where a built-in bot says whatever you type)
- Embed Links/Attach Files
> Able to show link previews, and attach files/photos into chat.
- Message History
> Ability to read messages before they joined the Channel. If disabled it tells them they can't read older messages.
- Mention Everyone
>This feature allows whoever has it to @everyone or @here on the server, allowing them to 'summon' everyone. (Notification causing)
- Use External Emojis
> Emojis can now be created by servers, this allows/disallows users from using those emoji's from their other servers.

### Voice Channel Permissions
- Connect/Speak
> Ability to join/talk in the Voice Chat
- Defean/Mute Members
> Being able to Server Mute/Deafen other users. Example: Mod mutes Jenny, noone can hear Jenny now.
- Move Members
> This allows anyone with it to drag a User from one Voice Channel to another at any time.
- Use Voice Activity
> Voice Acitivy disables Push-To-Talk (Push-To-Talk means you have to hit a button/hotkey in order to have your Mic recieving.

### Finally using what you've learned
You can use the permission key by deciding what each role on your server (Admin, Mod, Etc) should be able to do in the chat. You want to keep in mind each permission goes to EVERY member who has that role. Channel permissions are inherited from server roles.  If a role has a permission, you can deny ( ![firstclickpermissions](http://i.imgur.com/vIhIsi4.png) ) that permission in whatever channels you choose. For example, a server role that has the Attach Files permission, has permission to attach in all channels unless their permission has been denied in that channel specifically
> Example of a Server Moderator's permissions compared to a *trial* moderator's. The trial moderator can moderate everywhere except certain determined channels.
