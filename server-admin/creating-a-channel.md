Creating a Channel
==================

So, you've created a server, have you? Well, this guide will cover what channels are and how to create a channel.

What is a Channel?
------------------

A channel in Discord is a place where users can chat and talk. There are two types of channels, text channels and voice channels. Text channels are IRC type channels with just text, while voice channels allow users to talk through their microphone. There are different options for these channels, one being the name which will show up on the channel list on the left of Discord, and also options for which roles can get into the channel and which cannot.

How to Create a Text Channel
----------------------------

Once a server is made, you will have a default text channel called \#general. To create a new text channel, simply click the '+' button next to the 'Text Channels' text. Unless you have the permissions or own the server, you cannot create or edit text channels or voice channels.

In the channel creation dialog, you can change the name of the channel you are creating, which will show up as \# and your channel name. Under that is the option for only allowing specific roles into the server. If everyone is to be let into the server, keep @everyone on. We will discuss server roles in a different guide.

Clicking the gear next to the channel name (when highlighted will show 'Edit Channel') will open a settings dialog.

The 'Edit Channel' button

The name of the channel can be changed, so can the channel topic. The topic will change the text that appears on the top of Discord when you are on the channel, which you can click to expand. To delete your channel, click the trash can button on the bottom of the dialog.

On the other tab in the dialog called 'Instant Invites', you can revoke invite links created by other people. To create your own invite, click the box with the arrow next to your channel name on the channel list.

Give the link to anyone you want to invite to your server/channel or click the Twitter icon to share it on Twitter. The green time is how long the link will last, so once that gets to 0, no one can join from the link. To change some advanced settings, click the 'Advanced Settings' button. The Expire After duration will change when the invite expires, the Max Uses will make the invite expire once a certain number of people have joined, Temporary Membership means that unless a role is assigned to a user that joined from the link, they will be kicked from the server, and Human Readable changes the link of the invite to three random words, based on http://xkcd.com/936/.

How to Create a Voice Channel
-----------------------------

Creating a voice channel is similar to creating a text channel. To create a voice channel, click the '+' button next to the voice channels text. Voice channels will always be under text channels. The dialog is the same for voice channels, and so are the invites.

The settings dialog is slightly different, however. The bitrate determines the amount of bits going to and from the server. Higher bitrate is better audio quality, but may affect people on mobile or poor internet quality without much benefit. The user limit specifies how many users can be on the channel at the same time.

How to Create an AFK Channel
-----------------------------

An AFK channel is a voice channel that automatically puts in users if they have been idle for a certain amount of time. To create an AFK channel, firstly create a voice channel with an appropriate name, then click the three bars on the top left of Discord, next to your server name.

Click server settings, and click the dropdown option for AFK channel. You can then set the AFK Channel as the channel you just created, and set the AFK timer which determines how many minutes the user has to be idle to be moved to the AFK channel.
