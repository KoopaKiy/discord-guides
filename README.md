- Categories go into their own folders with lowercase dash-separated names
- Category folders contain a `category.json` file with information about the category. An example of a file using this format can be found in [example/category.json](https://github.com/TheCrossroads/discord-guides/blob/master/example/category.json)
- Document files are written in Markdown (`.md` files)
- Document files follow a set style-guide, as outlined in [example/document.md](https://github.com/TheCrossroads/discord-guides/blob/master/example/document.md)
- An example document can be found at [example/example.md](https://github.com/TheCrossroads/discord-guides/blob/master/example/example.md)
