# How to Create a Server
This guide will walk you through server creation. Let's get right into it, shall we?

### Step 1: Open the server join/create dialog
First thing we need to do is open the dialog for creating a server in your Discord client.
You can find the server join/create dialog at the bottom of your servers list in Discord. It looks like this:

Once you have that open, you need to click the purple "Create a Server" button.

### Step 2: Enter a server name, location, and icon
Once you have the server creation dialog open, go ahead and enter a server name, location, and icon.

Your server region decides where voice chat is hosted for the server.
Picking a region close to you and your friends should work for most people.

### Step 3: Click the purple "Create" button
Once you're ready to create your server, click the "Create" button in the bottom-right of the server creation dialog to create the server.

You should be taken to a new server on your sidebar and join voice.

You can invite your friends by creating an invite link, too!
