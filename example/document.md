# Example document title, should be the same as in the metadata
This is the opening text for your document, make it engaging so people bother reading it.
Your document title should be the only H1 on the page, i.e. the only line with a single `#` in front of it in the document.

## Section title
All non-step titles should be H2s, i.e. the only lines with two `#`s in front of it.

### Step 1: Steps aren't required
Steps can be used to guide users step by step through a process. If steps aren't required, just use a section.

## Other document information
- Use language codeblocks whenever possible
- Use blockquotes for quotes
- Images should be on their own line
- Only use steps when necessary, steps shouldn't be used for a non-linear process
- No titles or subtitles should end in a fullstop

You can find an example document with actual information about how to do something in example.md.
