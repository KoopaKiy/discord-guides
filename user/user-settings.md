#User Settings
There are quite a few settings that you can customize with your discord account.

To open these settings, click on the gear icon in the bottom left of the screen.

**1.** Your username. This can be changed twice per hour.

**2.** Your email. Only you can see this, and will be used if you ever need to recover your password or verify your IP

**3.** Your password.

**4.** Your avatar. This is global for your account.

##Connections

**1.** The available connections you can make to your account.

**2.** Normally, this would show the username on Twitch that is connected to this account.
