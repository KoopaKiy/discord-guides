#User Settings
There are quite a few settings that you can customize with your discord account.

To open these settings, click on the gear icon in the bottom left of the screen.

##Account

This is the screen you'll see when you first create an account. First, you should fill in an email and password so you can log into your account later. After entering the email and password, check your email and verify the account.

**1.** Your username. This can be changed twice per hour.

**2.** Your email. Only you can see this, and will be used if you ever need to recover your password or verify your IP

**3.** Your password. If you make any changes to your email or Username, you will need this.

**4.** Your avatar. This is global for your account.

##Connections

**2.** Normally, this would show the username on Twitch that is connected to this account.

**3.** Displays the server for any Twitch subscriptions you have.

**4.** Same as **2.**, but for Youtube.

**5.** Same as **3.**, but for Youtube.

##Friends

##Text & Images

**1.** This controls if Discord shows images posted to chat.

**2.** Controls the link previews. This includes Youtube videos.

**3.** Converts your emojis. This only controls what you send.

**4.** Global disable of Text To Speech. With this off, you will not hear TTS, no matter the channel settings.

##Voice

This one has two menus. Let's start on Basic.

![Basic](http://i.imgur.com/znIX550.png)

**1.** What device you want Discord to listen to. AKA, your microphone. Default uses whatever the system has set.

**2.** Same deal as above, but for your headphones/speakers.

**3.** Volume bars to control how loud you or others are globally.

**4.** Choose Push to Talk or Voice Activity. PPT requires you to press a key whenever you want to talk. Voice Activity listens for whenever your sound goes over a certain threshhold.

**a.** What you want your PPT key to be.

**b.** How long you want Discord to wait after you press your key to when people can hear you.

**a.** Do you want Discord to automatically see what the base noise is and tell when you are talking?

**b.** Change how much noise is required to pick you up.

And now for the Advanced menu.

![Advanced](http://i.imgur.com/4VcEioo.png)

**1.** Should Discord try and cancel out any echos it hears? For example, if your speakers are too loud and your mic picks it up.

**2.** Noise Suppression is when Discord tries to cancel out any noise it hears that is not your lovely voice.

**3.** This allows Discord to try and even out your voice so that it doesn't kill peoples ears if you SUDDENLY SHOUT.

**4.** Attenuation is the lowering of other sounds so that you can hear Discord better. Set it far to the left to disable.

**5.** This shows a bright red banner at the top if Discord can't hear you.

**6.** Resets your voice settings to defaults.

##Notifications

![Notifs](http://i.imgur.com/5IDtZjs.png)

**1.** Global setting for if you want Discord to be able to send you Desktop Notifications.

**2.** More TTS settings. If you have the previous setting on, this controls which channels you hear TTS from.
