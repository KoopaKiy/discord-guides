# Direct Messages and Friends: The Basics
This guide will show you through some of the basic features and areas surrounding the direct messages and friends interfaces.
Let's get right into it, shall we?

## Direct Messages Overview

This screen outlines your private communications to other users on Discord.

1. Direct message and friends list access button - takes you to your private messages list
2. Friends list view - toggles the friends list view
3. Direct message notifications - in the example I have 2 new messages from one user
4. Chat overview - you can view your previous messages and send new messages from here
5. Send message box - you can send messages and attachments from here
6. Direct messages list - a list of all of your direct message history
7. Your information - your username and discriminator, which can be given to any friends that don't share any servers with you so they can talk to you
8. Search users box - you can search for any user that you share servers with from here and direct message them

Let's say you wanted to talk to *Jimmy*.
Let's say that *Jimmy* shares two Discord servers with you (we'll get into more details about servers in a moment), Discord.FM and The Crossroads.
You want to talk to *Jimmy* in a private (direct) message, so that no one else can see your conversation.
You can use the user search box **(8)** to find and talk to Jimmy easily.

Here's an example of me searching for a user named *Zeludon*, one of my buds:

As you can see, I share quite a few servers with Zeludon, and if I want to ever talk to him in PM for whatever reason I can just click his name.

# Friends Overview

This screen shows you your friends and blocked users on Discord.

1. Friends list view - toggles the friends list view
2. Add friend button - allows you to add friends on Discord through a username + discriminator
3. Friends list filters - allows you to pick who is shown in the friends list below (defaults to `Online`)
4. Friends list - clicking on a user opens a direct message channel for that user

For example, if I wanted to talk to my friend *#ZounceX*, I can click on his listing in the friends list shown in the screenshot.

The filters shown at the top allow you to pick what type of friend is shown.
You can pick from `All` (all friends), `Online` (online friends only), `Pending` (pending friend requests), and `Blocked` (blocked users).

Blocking a user stops direct messages between you and the blocked user.
