# Extra Channel Tips
There are a couple of extra features that have been added in more recently to make your life easier. Namely Recent Mentions and Pinned Messages.

# Recent Mentions
Have a little red dot more than fifty messages up, and are too lazy to scroll to find it? No problem, Discord has you covered! Simply click the @ symbol at the top right and see who has been trying to get your attention.

Now you should be greeted with a window showing all your recent mentions. You can view them by All Servers, or just This Server.

If you click on any of the message mentions, it will jump you to that message and you can read the context. Cool!

# Pinned Messages
Pinned messages are located once again at the top right menu. They are per-channel, and marked by the admins/moderators. If it has a little red dot next to it, that means there's been a new pin since you last looked.

After clicking on this, you should see one of two things. Either a sad face saying there are no pins, or a list of messages that the moderators have marked as important. Clicking on these will jump you to that message so that you can read the context.

You can have up to fifty pins, and you need Manage Messages in order to pin things (unless you're in a private chat, anyone can pin things there). To pin a message, click the gear on the right hand side of the message, and select 'Pin'.

Next, confirm it.

Congrats! You pinned a message and can now jump to it at any point.
