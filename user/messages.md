# Messages
Discord mainly revolves around text communications through messages and embeded links or images.

# Sending messages

1. Message sending box - type your message in here and it will be sent and viewable by everyone with permission to read that channel's messages
2. Emoji picker open/close button
3. Emoji picker
4. Emoji default skin colour picker - allows you to pick your default emoji skin colour
5. File uploader

Discord's servers are really cool, and all messages with links inside will be changed into page titles and descriptions.
Any images will be displayed in chat, too.

If for whatever reason you don't want a link you sent to show information or embed into the chat, you can surround the link with angle brackets.
For example, `<http://example.com>` will not be embeded into chat - but it will be clickable.

Additionally, you can mention and add emojis to your message directly from the chatbox.

Be careful, though. People often hate being mentioned for useless reasons.

# Receiving messages

1. A message
2. The author's avatar
3. The author's server nickname or username
4. A timestamp for the message (in your computer's timezone)
5. Message content or embeds
6. A list of people typing in the channel

# Editing and deleting messages

If you suddenly regret your message or made a spelling mistake, you can always edit or delete your messages.
Some bots do log messages though, and you may get NSAed.
