# Server Overview
This guide will show you through some of the basic features and areas surrounding server communication on Discord.

## How to join a server

Firstly, you need to join a server.

To join a server, you need to scroll down to the bottom of your servers list until you see the `+` icon.

Once you've opened that, you need to click the green `Join a Server` button.
The screen will now ask for an invite code or link. You can get these from your friends or server officials.

Click the `Join` button in the bottom right to be taken to the server that the invite link points to!

## Server Overview

Once you're in a server, you will be able to see the server overview screen.

This screen outlines server communication, members, channels, information, and messages in a server on Discord.

1. Server list - a list of servers that you are in
2. Server name - the name of the server you are currently viewing
3. Server channels list - a list of channels that you have permission to read messages in on the server
4. Server notifications, privacy settings, server settings, nickname change, and leave server buttons - will go into more depth in a bit
5. Current text channel name and topic
6. Text channel mute button + hide/show server members button
7. Server members list - organized into roles on most servers
8. Message view - a list of all messages that you can see in the text channel
9. Send message button
10. Voice connection information (if you are in voice) - voice debug and disconnect buttons
11. Voice connection mute and deafen buttons + user settings buttons

As you can see, the server shown in the screenshot is `The Crossroads`, and I am currently viewing the #general text channel in this server.
I'm also in a voice channel called `Electro Hub` on `Discord.FM (Alpha)`, as shown in box 10.

To view a text channel, you can click it. You will instantly be taken to the messages screen for that channel.
To join a voice channel, you can click it. Your client will connect to the voice channel and begin broadcasting your voice if you have permission and aren't muted **(11)**.

As shown in the users list on the right sidebar **(7)**, users have been organized into roles.
Roles denote permissions levels on a server, and assign colours to users inside of the role.

If you click a user in this sidebar, you will be presented with information about the user.

User left click menu:

User right click menu:

These menus can be used to find more information about a user and to kick or ban users from your own servers.
