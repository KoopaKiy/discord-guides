# Discord: The Basics
Welcome to the basic guide to discord! 
Here you will learn a bit about the basics of how to use Discord.

##The initial screen

First, we'll show you a couple screens and what they do! 
First up is your Friends List **(2)**. 
This shows you who's online, their status, and what servers you share. 
To the left of that **(3)** is your Direct Message (DM) list. 
To send a new DM, you can search their name in the search bar **(4)** or left click/right click their names. 
To go back to your Friends List, just click the Friends button **(1)**

##Main Discord Window

Next up is a server! This is what you'll be seeing the most of in Discord. 
The leftmost bar **(1)** is your server list.  
This list is sortable, so if you want your most popular servers in a different order, feel free to just drag them around till you get them into the order you like. 
The white dots beside the server icon indicate there are unread messages in that server. 
To the right of that **(2)** is the server's channel list. 
This is where you select a text channel to view, and optionally a voice channel to speak in. 
The white dot beside the channel name indicates there are unread messages in that channel.  
The middle bit **(3)** is the text channel itself, where you chat with others, use bots or anything else! 
On the far right side **(4)** is the online list.  
This list is optionally sorted by ranks, for example in the picture you see the mods and bots are sorted separately from the other people.  
On top **(5)** is the channel topic. 
This is sometimes where a small description about the channel is placed. 
In the upper left **(6)** is the channel mute/hide online buttons are. 
If you do not wish to see unread notifications for a channel, select that channel and click the mute button, which looks like a bell. 
The button beside that to hide the online sidebar.



##Creating invites to a server

To invite somebody to your server, you just hit the create instant invite button. This creates a direct link to that text/voice channel.  You can also customize your invites with expiration time, max uses, a human readable url, and temporary membership (This means that they will be removed from the server when they log off discord, unless they are assigned a role.  These options are found in the "Advanced Settings" button when you create an instant invite. If you don't choose anything the default options are 24 hour expiry with no limit on uses.

To get your friends to join, simply have them paste the link in a browser to join instantly, or with the app, in the join server dialog. This is found in the bottom left of your server list.  It's the big "+".
